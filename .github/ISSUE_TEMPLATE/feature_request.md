## What is it?
Please describe your idea in detail. Is it related to a problem? What value does it add?

### Examples for you:
- **Problem-solving**: I'm thinking that a file manager could be added, this would add extra convenience and solve the problem of needing the terminal for basic file management.
- **General improvement**: We could add a new dynamic appearance using the neomorphic style called "Material You Neo", that adapts to your wallpaper and introduces expressive UI elements like Floating Action Buttons (FABs) and more.

## Got a basic flow?
Please insert a flow of User Interaction

## Got a mock up?
